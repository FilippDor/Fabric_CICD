## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please email the maintainer directly at **filippos.dorezi@gmail.com** with:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

You should receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours. We will work with you to understand the issue and coordinate a fix before any public disclosure.

## Security Considerations

This project handles sensitive credentials (Azure AD Service Principal secrets). When using this framework:

- **Never commit `.env` files** to version control (`.env` is gitignored by default).
- **Use GitHub Secrets** for CI/CD — never hardcode credentials in workflow files.
- **Rotate Service Principal secrets** regularly according to your organization's policy.
- **Use least-privilege access** — the Service Principal only needs Contributor access to the specific Power BI workspace being tested.
- **Review embed tokens** — embed tokens generated by this framework are short-lived and scoped to View access only.
